## Introduction

In the wake of becoming a victim of identity theft, an experience that brought to light the vulnerabilities in our banking system, I was compelled to take action. The distress and complications that followed were not only frustrating but eye-opening. It dawned on me that many people might be unaware of the security standards or fraud rates associated with their banks, especially as these can vary significantly by state. This realization led to the birth of the Bank Safety Comparator project.

## Project Overview

The Bank Safety Comparator is a tool designed to empower users by providing them with critical information about the safety of different banks, with a focus on fraud rates per state. The inception of this project stems from my personal ordeal with identity theft, which underscored the need for greater transparency and accessible information regarding bank safety.

Our journey begins with a straightforward SQL query that leverages data from two different databases. Each database contains information on various banks, including the number of accounts and instances of fraud, organized by state. The goal is to compare these figures to determine which bank offers a safer banking experience in each state.

## Initial Steps

The project kicks off with the development of a basic SQL setup designed to compare data from the two databases. This initial step is crucial for identifying discrepancies in fraud rates and serves as the foundation for the entire project.

## From Data to Insights

Following the backend setup, the next phase involves creating a user-friendly website front end. This platform will not only showcase the comparative data in an easily digestible format but also provide users with insights into which banks are safer. The website aims to be a go-to resource for individuals seeking to make informed decisions about where to entrust their money.

## Expansion and Automation

As the project evolves, I plan to expand the database to encompass a broader spectrum of data points and incorporate APIs to automate more complex tasks. These enhancements will allow for a more comprehensive analysis and enable the platform to offer updated information seamlessly.

## The Future: AI Integration

The ultimate vision for the Bank Safety Comparator is to integrate AI capabilities, enabling the system to interact directly with users. This AI will not only provide information from the databases but also offer personalized recommendations based on user-specific criteria. By harnessing the power of AI, the platform aims to deliver a tailored experience that maximizes relevance and value for each user.

## Conclusion

The journey from falling victim to identity theft to creating a solution that could potentially safeguard others has been both challenging and rewarding. The Bank Safety Comparator project embodies my commitment to turning a personal setback into an opportunity to empower others. By providing accessible, comprehensive data on bank safety, we can make informed decisions that protect our financial wellbeing. Join me in this endeavor to make banking safer for everyone.
